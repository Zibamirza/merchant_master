Merchant Master: An Efficient Merchant Name Extraction and Mining Tool
In this project, we analyzed the data from >2400 rows of transactions and extracted merchant names in order to mine additional data and categorize them systematically. Given that much of these merchants are small and medium enterprises in Switzerland, the value proposition of this project is to obtain comprehensive data about these organizations since they typically lack comprehensive data (unlike large corporations which have information available in Bloomberg, Compustat and S&P 500).
